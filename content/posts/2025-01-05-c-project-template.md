As much as I love C, the developer experience provided by the language is pretty lacking. If you compare it to more modern languages like Go, Zig, or Rust, you'll soon realize it's nice to have a single executable that not only compiles your programs but also formats, provides an LSP, and runs your tests etc.

That's not to say tools don't exist to provide you with all of these features. It's just __your__ responsibility to assemble all the parts. Which can be tedious. This is the setup that I've come to use when developing C using Visual Studio Code.

## TLDR;
You can check out my [gist](https://gist.github.com/hosackm/c3e34d75a1f4496b6f5aec1803aa2032#file-readme-md) if you don't feel like reading the article.

## A Good Template

When I'm starting a new project I expect it to have some of the following things to make my life easier:

* Can be simply copied for use in a new project
* Makes my code styled similarly across projects
* Makes integrating other libraries simple
* Can easily be expanded upon

## Tools
I use all the following tools in any of my projects:

* cmake - generating build files and integrating other cmake projects.
* clang-format - for formatting and enforcing a style guide.
* clangd - for LSP features.
