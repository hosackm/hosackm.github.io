I'm Matt, a software engineer originally from the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up playing music and developed an early passion for using technology to create and manipulate sound. I studied Electrical Engineering and Music in university, where I fell in love with software engineering and music production tools like Ableton Live.

After graduating, I began my career at [THX](https://thx.com) and later joined [Dolby](https://dolby.com), where I worked on streaming technologies used by Apple and Netflix, and led the engineering effort to deliver Dolby’s first containerized Atmos Music encoding workflow.

In 2020, I moved to Berlin and joined [Ableton](https://ableton.com), where I helped build infrastructure for developing and shipping Packs, the sound content used in Ableton Live. My work included building indexing and search tools, custom CI systems, and static analysis pipelines to validate instruments, devices, and samples.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing piano and guitar, playing basketball and volleyball, and [homebrewing](https://share.brewfather.app/T5XOsCrEYNkTCT) delicious beer for friends and family.
